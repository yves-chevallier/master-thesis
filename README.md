# Master's thesis

The Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (S.M.A.R.T) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed new imaging techniques for multi-plane imaging and phase retrieving for transparent objects. Our plan is to assess the feasibility for three-dimensional reconstruction of biological cells with projected tomography. In order to achieve this, optical tweezers have been used. We successfully demonstrated the capabilities of optical trapping for rotating particles around an axis perpendicular to the imaging axis. We also suggested the building of a microtool in SU-8 to grab and rotate a living cell.
